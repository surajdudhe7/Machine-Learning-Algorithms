# Random Forest

## Description

This repository contains code for implementing the Random Forest algorithm in Python using the scikit-learn library.

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `RandomForest.py` file to see the implementation of Random Forest on the provided datasets.
4. Explore the code to understand how Random Forest works and how the datasets are preprocessed and visualized.

## Datasets

The datasets used in this example are:

- `Social_Network_Ads.csv`: Contains information about users' age, estimated salary, and whether they purchased a product advertised on a social network.
- `Position_Salaries.csv`: Contains information about employees' position levels and their corresponding salaries.

## Visualizations

The code includes visualizations of the training and test set results using matplotlib. These visualizations help in understanding how the Random Forest algorithm performs on the datasets.
