# Naive Bayes

This repository contains code for implementing the Naive Bayes algorithm in Python using scikit-learn library. 

## Description

Naive Bayes is a simple and efficient classification algorithm that is based on the Bayes theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `NaiveBayes.py` file to see the implementation of Naive Bayes on the Social Network Ads dataset.
4. Explore the code to understand how Naive Bayes works and how the dataset is preprocessed and visualized.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this example is the Social Network Ads dataset, which contains information about users' age, estimated salary, and whether they purchased a product advertised on a social network.

## Visualizations

The code includes visualizations of the training and test set results using matplotlib. These visualizations help in understanding how the Naive Bayes algorithm separates the classes in the dataset.
