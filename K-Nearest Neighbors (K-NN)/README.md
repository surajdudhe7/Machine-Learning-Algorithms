# K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)

This repository contains code for implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm in Python using scikit-learn library. 

## Description

K-Nearest Neighbors is a simple and intuitive classification algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `KNN.py` file to see the implementation of K-NN on the Social Network Ads dataset.
4. Explore the code to understand how K-NN works and how the dataset is preprocessed and visualized.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this example is the Social Network Ads dataset, which contains information about users' age, estimated salary, and whether they purchased a product advertised on a social network.

## Visualizations

The code includes visualizations of the training and test set results using matplotlib. These visualizations help in understanding how the K-NN algorithm separates the classes in the dataset.
